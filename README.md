## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This project uses the Pandas, Numpy and seaborn library as well as matplotlib for visualizations. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb Seattle data of 2016 to better understand:

1. Which Seattle area is the most popular and most expensive one for travel accomodations? Is price and area correlated?
2. What factors influence the price of Airbnb accomodations in Seattle?
3. Has the best area also the best reviews? What factors influence the reviews of Airbnb accomodations in Seattle?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The Jupyter notebook with the detailed analysis is available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
