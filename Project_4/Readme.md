## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is my final project in the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. To proof my Data Science skills and to earn the Data Science Nanodegree certificate, I will provide a customer segmentation report for Bertelsmann/arvato emphasizing the attributes of the customers - especially with regards to the general population in Germany. Furthermore, I will analyze the dataset with Machine Learning Models to find out what kind of people attributes will likely lead to a positive response regarding customer acquisition.
