## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This project uses Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib and some sklearn libraries. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is my final project in the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. To proof my Data Science skills and to earn the Data Science Nanodegree certificate, I will provide a customer segmentation report for Bertelsmann/arvato emphasizing the attributes of the customers - especially with regards to the general population in Germany. Furthermore, I will analyze the dataset with Machine Learning Models to find out what kind of people attributes will likely lead to a positive response regarding customer acquisition.

In order to comply with the licensing agreement, I will not publish the original dataset on my Githup Repro but I have uploaded the cleaned, reduced and scaled dataset for the Segmentation Report to follow my Jupyther notebook along.
