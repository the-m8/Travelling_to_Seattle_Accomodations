## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This project uses Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib and some sklearn libraries. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is my final project in the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. To proof my Data Science skills and to earn the Data Science Nanodegree certificate, I will provide a customer segmentation report for Bertelsmann/arvato emphasizing the attributes of the customers - especially with regards to the general population in Germany. Furthermore, I will analyze the dataset with Machine Learning Models to find out what kind of people attributes will likely lead to a positive response regarding customer acquisition. 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 2 files provided for the customer segmentation report, one of them containing information about the general population in Germany, the other containing information about the customers of the mail-order company. For the supervised machine learning model, two additional files were provided (training and testing set). The Testing set is basis for the Kaeggle competition. All files are not cleaned and will be cleaned in the process.

## Results <a name="results"></a>

The results can be found in my [medium blogpost](https://medium.com/@monakeller94/how-to-describe-customers-and-effectively-acquire-new-ones-from-an-data-science-perspective-a84a3f3a4ade).
